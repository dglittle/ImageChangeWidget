- fork https://github.com/dglittle/ImageChangeWidget
- copy-paste this job description to new file: humanscript/AA578/hs.txt
- widget is currently 2x2
    - make it 1x1
    - may require resizing the images
- create a new icon to represent a "working" state
    - I don't care what it looks like
    - maybe it can be an hourglass
- if icon has eyes open, and user clicks icon:
    - set icon to "working" icon
    - let x = a random number from 0 to 1
    - if x < 0.5
        - make http request to www.google.com
    - else
        - make http request to http://blahblahblah5678123.com
        - this domain should not exist
    - if the http request succeeds
        - change icon to eyes closed
    - else
        - change icon to eyes open
- if icon has eyes closed, and user clicks icon:
    - do the same thing as before,
        except if the request succeeds,
            change the icon to eyes open,
        else,
            change the icon to eyes closed
- take screenshot of widget running on phone in "eyes closed" state
- put screenshot in humanscript/AA578 directory
- make pull request to original repo
- send me message saying it is done

- in your cover-letter, please summarize what I want.

Thanks,
Greg
